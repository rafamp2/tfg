# TFG Marta Gago Mac√≠as

This is the repository of the app I presented as my Bachelor of Science Thesis in Computer Science. It's an app developed in python that with the use of different AI models creates a chatbot where an user can maintain a conversation with a historical figure about their life and experiences.
The example case used is Francisco de Arobe, an important latin american ruler from the XVI century.
